# Travel log website

## Spec
The website will help users store their memories in form of text and image entries from the tirps they took.
It will be a form of journal. The travel log homepage will describe the page and invite the users 
to register or log in.
Once logged in the user will be able to create new trips, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
